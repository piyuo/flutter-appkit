## üîÑ Workflow Overview

Our workflow emphasizes **clean commit history** and **milestone-driven releases**:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "v1.0.0"
    branch issue-17-fix-auth
    checkout issue-17-fix-auth
    commit id: "WIP: auth changes"
    commit id: "fix: typo"
    commit id: "refactor: cleanup"
    checkout main
    merge issue-17-fix-auth id: "fix: authentication bug in login flow #17"
    branch issue-25-add-feature
    checkout issue-25-add-feature
    commit id: "feat: new feature"
    checkout main
    merge issue-25-add-feature id: "feat: add user dashboard feature #25"
    commit id: "v1.1.0"
```

### Key Principles
- **One clean commit per issue** when merged to main
- **Rebase and merge only** - no merge commits
- **Milestone-driven releases** - all issues must belong to a milestone
- **Draft PRs for early collaboration** with reviewers
- **Clear PR-Issue linking** - PR titles must include issue number

## üìä Issue and Milestone Management

### Creating Issues
All work must begin with a GitHub Issue:

1. **Select milestone first** - Choose from available milestones
2. **Use issue templates** - Bug Report or Feature Request
3. **Fill out completely** - All template fields are required
4. **Estimate effort** - Use story points (1 point ‚âà 2 hours, max 20 points per week)

### Large Feature Management
For complex features, we use **Epic + Sub-issues** approach:

1. **Epic Issue** - Main feature request with overview and background
2. **Team Planning** - Collaborative breakdown into sub-issues (1-2 days each)
3. **Sub-issue Creation** - Each with clear acceptance criteria
4. **Team Assignment** - Developers claim specific sub-issues
5. **Coordinated Development** - All sub-issues tracked in project board

#### Issue Types and Commit Prefixes:
| Issue Type      | Commit Prefix | Version Impact | Example                                 |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Bug Report      | `fix:`        | Patch          | `fix: resolve payment gateway timeout`  |
| Feature Request | `feat:`       | Minor          | `feat: add user profile management`     |
| Documentation   | `docs:`       | None*          | `docs: update API authentication guide` |
| Refactoring     | `refactor:`   | None*          | `refactor: optimize database queries`   |
| Maintenance     | `chore:`      | None*          | `chore: update dependencies to latest`  |

*\*Does not trigger version bumps by release-please*

### Milestone Management
- **All issues must have a milestone** assigned before starting work
- **Milestones represent development cycles** - e.g., "Sprint 7 - Payment Integration"
- **Version numbers determined by release-please** based on commit types
- **Release when milestone complete** - all issues closed

## üöÄ Development Process

### 1. Create Issue Branch
1. Navigate to your assigned GitHub Issue
2. Click "Create a branch for this issue"
3. **Source**: Always branch from `main`
4. **Naming**: GitHub auto-generates (e.g., `17-fix-payment-gateway`)

### 2. Start with Draft PR (Recommended)
Create a **Draft PR** immediately for early collaboration:

```bash
# After first commit
git push -u origin <branch-name>
# Create Draft PR on GitHub
```

**Benefits of Draft PRs:**
- Early feedback from CODEOWNERS reviewers
- Discuss approach before implementation
- Avoid large changes at review time
- Track progress transparently

### 3. Development and Commits
During development, commit frequently with descriptive messages:

```bash
# Examples of work-in-progress commits
git commit -m "WIP: initial authentication setup"
git commit -m "add password validation logic"
git commit -m "fix: handle edge case for empty passwords"
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation functions"
git commit -m "docs: add authentication flow diagram"
```

## üìù Commit Management

### Before Requesting Review
**Always clean up your commit history** using interactive rebase:

```bash
# First, make sure you have the latest changes from main
git fetch origin

# Rebase and squash commits (this only affects commits unique to your branch)
git rebase -i origin/main

# Example: Squash multiple commits into one clean commit
# Before:
# fix: initial auth setup
# refactor: cleanup code
# fix: handle edge cases
# docs: add comments

# After:
# fix: resolve authentication timeout issues
```

**Note**: Using `git rebase -i origin/main` ensures you only rebase commits that are unique to your feature branch, avoiding conflicts with unrelated commits that may have been added to main since you branched.

### Final Commit Requirements
Your **first commit** must follow release-please requirements:

- **Use conventional commit format**: `<type>: <description>`
- **Must be `feat:` or `fix:`** to trigger version updates
- **Keep additional commits for reviewer context** (if any)

#### Good Examples:
```bash
feat: add user dashboard with activity metrics
fix: resolve payment gateway connection timeout
refactor: optimize database query performance
```

#### Bad Examples:
```bash
WIP: working on dashboard  # ‚ùå Not conventional format
Update code  # ‚ùå Not descriptive
feat add dashboard  # ‚ùå Missing colon
```

## üîÄ Pull Request Process

### Before Creating/Converting PR

1. **Sync with main branch**:
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>
```

2. **Clean up commits** using interactive rebase
3. **Run all tests and linting** locally

### Creating the PR

Use our **PR template** which includes:

**Required Sections:**
- **Checklist** - Code standards, testing, documentation
- **Testing** - How changes were tested, evidence provided
- **Deployment Notes** - Any special deployment considerations
- **Reviewer Notes** - Specific areas for review focus

**Template automatically populated** when creating PR from issue branch.

#### PR Title Format:
```
<type>: <description> #<issue-number>
```

**IMPORTANT**: PR title must include the issue number for proper linking and traceability.

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: add user dashboard with activity metrics #95
fix: resolve payment gateway connection timeout #142
docs: update API authentication guide #78
refactor: optimize database query performance #201
```

**Requirements:**
- **Must reflect the same intent as your first commit** (but doesn't need to be word-for-word identical)
- **Issue number is mandatory** - PRs without issue reference will be rejected
- **Format strictly enforced** - automated checks will validate PR title format

**Example of Intent Alignment:**
```bash
# First commit message:
feat: implement user dashboard with real-time activity tracking

# PR title (reflects same intent):
feat: add user dashboard with activity metrics #95
```

### Review Process

1. **CODEOWNERS automatically assigned** as reviewers
2. **Address feedback with additional commits** (don't squash during review)
3. **All CI checks must pass** before merge
4. **At least one approval required** from CODEOWNERS

### Merge Process

- **Only "Rebase and merge" allowed** - other options are disabled
- **Maintainer performs the merge** after approval
- **Branch automatically deleted** after merge
- **Final commit on main includes issue reference** from PR title

## üè∑Ô∏è Release Management

### Milestone Completion
When all issues in a milestone are completed:

1. **Release-please creates release PR** automatically
2. **Maintainer reviews and merges** release PR to main
3. **Automatic version bump and changelog** generation
4. **Git tag created** with version number
5. **CI/CD deployment triggered** automatically

### Version Strategy
Following **semantic versioning** (semver):

- **feat:** commits ‚Üí Minor version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.2.0)
- **fix:** commits ‚Üí Patch version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1)
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** ‚Üí Major version bump (1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

## üí° Code Standards

### Quality Requirements
- **All linting warnings resolved** before review
- **Test coverage ‚â• 80%** for new code
- **Unit tests required** for business logic
- **Integration tests required** for APIs

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: camelCase (JS/Dart) or snake_case (Python)
- **Functions**: Descriptive verbs (`getUserById`, `calculateTotal`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserService`, `PaymentGateway`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-service.js`, `payment-gateway.py`)

### Best Practices
- **Functions under 20 lines** (max 50 lines)
- **Single responsibility principle**
- **Maximum 3 levels of nesting**
- **Meaningful comments explain why, not what**
- **Remove dead code** before PR

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Git Operations

### Interactive Rebase Example
```bash
# Start interactive rebase (make sure to fetch first)
git fetch origin
git rebase -i origin/main

# In the editor, change 'pick' to 'squash' or 's' for commits to combine
pick abc1234 feat: add user authentication
squash def5678 fix: handle edge cases
squash ghi9012 refactor: cleanup validation logic

# Result: One clean commit with all changes
```

### Handling Review Changes
```bash
# Make changes based on review feedback
git add .
git commit -m "address review feedback: improve error handling"

# Push changes (PR updates automatically)
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## üîç Enhanced Traceability with Issue Linking

With our improved PR title format, traceability is significantly enhanced:

### Complete Traceability Chain
```
Issue #93 ‚Üí Branch 93-docs-update ‚Üí PR #94 "docs: update contributing guide #93" ‚Üí Commit "docs: update contributing guide #93"
```

### Finding Related Content
1. **From main branch commit**: Issue number is directly visible in commit message
2. **From commit to PR**: Click the `#PR-NUMBER` link below commit title
3. **From PR to issue**: Issue number in PR title links directly to original issue
4. **Reverse lookup**: GitHub automatically shows all PRs that reference an issue

### Benefits of Enhanced Linking
- **Instant issue identification** from any commit on main branch
- **Streamlined code archaeology** - easily trace why changes were made
- **Automated issue closing** - GitHub closes issues when PR with `#issue-number` is merged
- **Better project management** - clear visibility of which issues are in progress/completed
- **Improved changelog generation** - release notes can include issue context

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Should I squash commits during code review?**
A: No! Keep review changes as separate commits. Only clean up before initial review request.

**Q: What if I forget to add issue number to PR title?**
A: The PR will be rejected by automated checks. Update the title to include `#<issue-number>` format.

**Q: Can I reference multiple issues in one PR?**
A: No. Each PR should address only one issue. If you need to reference related issues, mention them in the PR description, not the title.

**Q: What if I need to update my branch during review?**
A: Rebase on main if needed, but don't squash review feedback commits until after approval.

**Q: Can I work on multiple issues simultaneously?**
A: Yes, but each must have its own branch and milestone assignment.

**Q: What happens if CI fails after merge?**
A: Create a hotfix issue and follow the same process. No direct commits to main allowed.

**Q: How do I handle breaking changes?**
A: Use the exclamation mark syntax in your commit type to trigger a major version bump:

```bash
# Breaking change examples:
feat!: change user ID from int to UUID

# Or with detailed explanation:
feat!: migrate authentication to OAuth 2.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Previous API key authentication is no longer supported.
Users must migrate to OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
```

**Q: How do we handle large features?**
A: Use Epic + Sub-issues approach. Team collaboratively breaks down the epic into 1-2 day sub-issues, each developer claims specific sub-issues and creates their own branch + PR.

**Q: What about hotfixes for production issues?**
A: We don't use hotfix branches. All changes follow the standard workflow. Production issues are handled at the deployment level using CI/CD rollback capabilities.

**Q: What if the issue number changes or gets closed before my PR?**
A: Update your PR title to reflect the correct issue number. If the issue is closed as duplicate, reference the new issue number.

**Q: Does my PR title need to be exactly the same as my first commit?**
A: No, the PR title should reflect the same intent as your first commit but doesn't need to be word-for-word identical. The important thing is that both clearly communicate what the change accomplishes.

**Q: Why should I use `git rebase -i origin/main` instead of `git rebase -i main`?**
A: Using `origin/main` ensures you're rebasing against the latest remote version of main, and it only affects commits unique to your feature branch. This prevents rebasing unrelated commits that might have been added to main since you created your branch.
