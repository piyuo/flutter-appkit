## ðŸš€ Release Overview

We use **Release Please** to automate versioning, changelog generation, and GitHub Releases based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Release Flow
```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Feature A"
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit id: "Feature B"
    commit id: "Feature C"
    commit id: "Bug Fix D"
    checkout main
    merge develop
    commit id: "Release v1.2.0"
    checkout develop
    merge main
    commit id: "Sync back"
```

### Key Principles
- **`main`** is the production/release branch
- **`develop`** contains integrated features ready for next release
- **Release Please** automatically handles versioning and changelogs
- **Milestones** track what goes into each release

## âœ… Pre-Release Checklist

Before initiating a release, the **develop branch owner** (usually project lead or release manager) must verify:

### 1. Milestone Completion
```
â–¡ All issues in target milestone are resolved
â–¡ All associated PRs are merged to develop
â–¡ No open issues blocking the release
â–¡ Milestone is marked as complete
```

### 2. Branch Status Verification
```
â–¡ All feature branches for this release are merged
â–¡ No unintended branches accidentally merged
â–¡ develop branch is stable and tested
â–¡ CI/CD pipeline passes on develop
```

### 3. Quality Gates
```
â–¡ All automated tests passing
â–¡ Code coverage meets requirements (80%+)
â–¡ Security scans completed
â–¡ Performance benchmarks acceptable
```

### 4. Documentation
```
â–¡ API documentation updated
â–¡ User-facing documentation current
â–¡ Migration guides prepared (if needed)
â–¡ Known issues documented
```

## ðŸ”„ Release Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Milestone Readiness

Check the target milestone (e.g., `v1.2.0`):

```bash
# Review milestone status
# Go to GitHub â†’ Issues â†’ Milestones
# Verify all issues are closed and PRs merged
```

**Common milestone issues to resolve:**
- **Unmerged PRs**: Ensure all feature branches are merged to develop
- **Scope creep**: Move non-essential items to next milestone
- **Blocking issues**: Resolve critical bugs before release
- **Accidental inclusions**: Remove unrelated branches that got merged

### Step 2: Clean Up develop Branch

Remove any unintended changes:

```bash
# Check what's in develop that wasn't planned
git log --oneline main..develop

# If there are unintended commits, create a cleanup branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b cleanup-pre-release
git revert <unintended-commit-hash>
git push origin cleanup-pre-release

# Create PR to develop to remove unintended changes
```

### Step 3: Create Release PR

Create a PR from `develop` to `main`:

```bash
# Ensure develop branch is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release PR
# Title: "Release v1.2.0 - [Milestone Name]"
# Description template:
```

**PR Template:**
```markdown
## Release: v1.2.0 - [Milestone Name]

### Summary
This PR merges the latest changes from `develop` to `main` to initiate the automated release process.

### Milestone: [Link to milestone]
- [ ] All milestone issues resolved
- [ ] All PRs merged to develop
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Changes in this Release
<!-- Auto-generated or manually list key features -->
- feat(auth): Add OAuth2 integration
- fix(ui): Resolve mobile responsive issues
- feat(api): New user management endpoints

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [ ] Milestone 100% complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation current
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### Post-Merge Actions
- [ ] Monitor Release Please PR creation
- [ ] Review automated changelog
- [ ] Merge Release Please PR
- [ ] Sync main back to develop
```

### Step 4: Review and Merge Release PR

1. **Team review**: Get approval from team leads
2. **Final testing**: Run any manual tests if needed
3. **Merge to main**: This triggers Release Please automation

### Step 5: Handle Release Please PR

After merging to main, Release Please will automatically:

1. **Create Release PR**: `chore(main): release v1.2.0`
2. **Generate changelog**: Based on conventional commits
3. **Calculate version**: Using semantic versioning rules

**Review the Release Please PR:**
```
â–¡ Version number is correct
â–¡ Changelog entries are accurate
â–¡ No sensitive information exposed
â–¡ Breaking changes properly documented
```

### Step 6: Finalize Release

Merge the Release Please PR to complete the release:

1. **Merge Release Please PR** â†’ Creates git tag and GitHub release
2. **Automated deployment** triggers (if configured)
3. **Release notes** published automatically

### Step 7: Sync Back to develop

**Critical**: Sync changes back to develop:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin main --no-ff
git push origin develop
```

This ensures develop has:
- Updated version numbers
- Latest CHANGELOG.md
- Any release-specific commits

## ðŸ“Š Milestone Management

### Creating Milestones

For each release, create a milestone:

```
Title: v1.2.0 - Authentication & Mobile Improvements
Due Date: 2025-07-15
Description:
- OAuth2 integration
- Mobile responsive fixes
- User management API
- Security enhancements
```

### Milestone Hygiene

**During development:**
- Assign issues to appropriate milestones
- Move issues between milestones as priorities change
- Close completed milestones promptly

**Before release:**
- Review milestone completion (should be 100%)
- Move incomplete items to next milestone
- Document any scope changes

### Milestone Reports

Generate milestone reports for stakeholders:
```bash
# Example metrics to track:
- Issues planned vs completed
- Story points estimated vs actual
- Timeline adherence
- Quality metrics (bugs found, test coverage)
```

```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Release Please Issues

**Problem**: Release Please creates wrong version number
```bash
# Solution: Usually due to incorrect commit formats
# Review recent commits for conventional commit compliance
git log --oneline main -10

# Edit the Release Please PR before merging
# Or create manual adjustment commit
```

**Problem**: Missing changelog entries
```bash
# Cause: Commits don't follow conventional format
# Solution: Manually edit CHANGELOG.md in Release Please PR
```

### Milestone Issues

**Problem**: Milestone not 100% complete at release time
```bash
# Options:
1. Delay release until complete
2. Move incomplete items to next milestone
3. Create patch release for critical items
```

**Problem**: Unplanned changes in develop
```bash
# Identify unplanned changes
git log --oneline main..develop

# Options:
1. Revert unplanned commits
2. Fast-track through review process
3. Move to next release
```

### Deployment Issues

**Problem**: Release deployment fails
```bash
# Immediate actions:
1. Check CI/CD pipeline logs
2. Verify environment health
3. Consider rollback if critical
4. Document issue for post-mortem
```

**Problem**: Critical bug found after release
```bash
# Follow hotfix process:
# See docs/HOTFIX_GUIDE.md for detailed procedures
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Release Metrics
