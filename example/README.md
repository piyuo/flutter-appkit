# Example

A project to demo flutter_appkit component

## Setup

### Environment Variables

Before running the example, you need to set up environment variables for sensitive data like Sentry DSN:

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your actual values:

   ```bash
   # Sentry DSN for error reporting
   SENTRY_DSN=https://your-actual-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/your-project-id
   ```

3. **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control as it contains sensitive information.

**Note**: This example uses the `flutter_dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file. No special command-line arguments are needed - the app will automatically load the variables at startup.

## Github

clone source code to local.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:piyuo/play.git
```

## Project

using project play.code-workspace

### Run the App

To run the app (environment variables are automatically loaded from `.env`):

```bash
# For mobile/desktop development
flutter run

# For web development
flutter run -d web-server
flutter run -d chrome --verbose
```

**Note**: The app automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file using the `flutter_dotenv` package. Make sure you have set up your `.env` file as described in the Environment Variables section above.

### Test

```bash
flutter test lib
```

### Run local web server

```bash
flutter build web --web-renderer html --profile --dart-define=Dart2jsOptimization=O0 -t lib/web/app/index.dart
cd build/web
http-server -p 3000 --cors
```

### ignore build folder in dropbox

``` bash
xattr -w com.dropbox.ignored 1 /Users/cc/Dropbox/play/build
```

### run web

```bash
flutter run -d web-server
flutter run -d chrome --verbose
```

### clean if something strange happen

``` bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### disable chrome CORS

1- Go to flutter\bin\cache and remove a file named: flutter_tools.stamp

2- Go to flutter\packages\flutter_tools\lib\src\web and open the file chrome.dart.

3- Find '--disable-extensions'

4- Add '--disable-web-security'

### CocoaPods's specs repository is too out-of-date to satisfy dependencies

``` bash
delete ios/Podfile.lock
cd ios
pod repo update
```

### if you encounter something like

``` bash
In Podfile:
        mobile_scanner (from `.symlinks/plugins/mobile_scanner/ios`) was resolved to 3.2.0, which depends on
          GoogleMLKit/BarcodeScanning (~> 4.0.0)
```

try

``` bash
rm ios/Podfile.lock
cd ios
pod repo update
```

```

### user image picker in mac os
