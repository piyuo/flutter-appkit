        # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:

        # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
        # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
        # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
        # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
        # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
        # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
        # example:
        # fonts:
        #   - family: Schyler
        #     fonts:
        #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
